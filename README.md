Did you know that: The average person perceives flicker up to about 60 to 90 Hz, although some individuals with exceptional vision can detect it up to 500 Hz under specific conditions.

I want to get more deeper in filmmaking and to be able to be the best Potato, in short be able to do anything that might be needed. 

Thats kinda all about me: If needed msgh me on the social media if there are any other questions or work/gigs for me hehe
